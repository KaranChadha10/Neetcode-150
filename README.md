3. **Use LeetCode's online judge** to test the solutions

Example:
```csharp
public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        var solution = new Solution();
        int[] nums = { 2, 7, 11, 15 };
        int target = 9;
        int[] result = solution.TwoSum(nums, target);
        Console.WriteLine($"[{result[0]}, {result[1]}]");
    }
}
```

## 💡 Solution Features

Each solution file includes:

### 1. Problem Description
```csharp
/*
PROBLEM: Two Sum
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices 
of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
...
*/
```

### 2. Detailed Comments
```csharp
// Calculate the complement needed to reach target
int complement = target - nums[i];
```

### 3. Complexity Analysis
```csharp
/*
TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n)
- Single pass through array
- Hash map operations are O(1)

SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(n)
- Hash map stores up to n elements
*/
```
