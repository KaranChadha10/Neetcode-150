/*
PROBLEM: Minimum Window Substring
Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window 
substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. 
If there is no such window, return the empty string "".

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.

Example 1:
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.

Example 2:
Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.

Example 3:
Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.

Constraints:
- m == s.length
- n == t.length
- 1 <= m, n <= 10^5
- s and t consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

Follow up: Could you find an algorithm that runs in O(m + n) time?

TIME COMPLEXITY: O(m + n)
- Building countT: O(n) where n = length of string t
- Sliding window: O(m) where m = length of string s
  - Right pointer visits each character once: O(m)
  - Left pointer moves at most m positions throughout entire algorithm: O(m)
  - Dictionary operations are O(1) on average
- Overall: O(m + n) which achieves the follow-up requirement

SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(m + n)
- countT dictionary: O(k) where k = unique characters in t, worst case O(n)
- window dictionary: O(k) where k = unique characters in s, worst case O(m)
- Other variables: O(1)
- Overall: O(m + n) in worst case

ALGORITHM EXPLANATION:
- Sliding window technique with variable window size
- Expand window until it contains all required characters
- Then shrink window while maintaining validity to find minimum size
- Track best (minimum) valid window found throughout the process

KEY INSIGHTS:
- Use 'have' and 'need' counters to efficiently track window validity
- have = number of character types that satisfy frequency requirements
- need = total number of unique character types in target string
- Window is valid when have == need (all character frequencies satisfied)

SLIDING WINDOW STRATEGY:
- Expand: Add characters to window until valid (have == need)
- Shrink: Remove characters from left while maintaining validity
- Track: Keep minimum valid window throughout the process

EXAMPLE TRACE with s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC":
- countT = {A:1, B:1, C:1}, need = 3
- Expand until window contains A, B, C with correct frequencies
- Window "ADOBEC" is first valid window (have = 3)
- Shrink from left: "DOBEC" still valid, "OBEC" not valid
- Continue expanding and shrinking...
- Final minimum window: "BANC" (length 4)

EDGE CASES HANDLED:
- No valid window exists: return ""
- Target string is empty: return ""
- Entire string s is the minimum window: correctly identified
- Target has duplicate characters: frequency tracking handles this

OPTIMIZATION BENEFITS:
- Avoids checking all possible substrings (O(mÂ²) approach)
- Each character processed at most twice (once by each pointer)
- Efficient tracking with have/need counters instead of comparing dictionaries
