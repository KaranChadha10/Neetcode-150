PROBLEM: Daily Temperatures
Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer 
such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. 
If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

Example 1:
Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
Output: [1,4,1,2,1,1,0,0]
Explanation:
- Day 0 (73°): Wait 1 day for 74° (warmer)
- Day 1 (74°): Wait 4 days for 76° (warmer)
- Day 2 (75°): Wait 1 day for 76° (warmer)
- Day 3 (71°): Wait 2 days for 72° (warmer)
- Day 4 (69°): Wait 1 day for 72° (warmer)
- Day 5 (72°): Wait 1 day for 76° (warmer)
- Day 6 (76°): No warmer day (0)
- Day 7 (73°): No warmer day (0)

Example 2:
Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
Output: [1,1,1,0]

Example 3:
Input: temperatures = [30,60,90]
Output: [1,1,0]

Constraints:
- 1 <= temperatures.length <= 10^5
- 30 <= temperatures[i] <= 100

        // Iterate through each day's temperature
        for (int i = 0; i < temperatures.Length; i++) {
            int t = temperatures[i]; // Current day's temperature
            
            // While stack not empty and current temp is warmer than stack top
            while (stack.Count > 0 && t > stack.Peek()[0]) {
                int[] pair = stack.Pop(); // Pop the colder day [temp, index]
                res[pair[1]] = i - pair[1]; // Calculate days waited (current day - past day)
            }
            
            // Push current day onto stack (waiting for a warmer day)
            stack.Push(new int[] { t, i });
        }
        
        return res; // Return result array
    }

/*
TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n)
- Each element is pushed onto stack exactly once: O(n)
- Each element is popped from stack at most once: O(n)
- Total operations: O(2n) = O(n) where n is length of temperatures array
- Despite nested while loop, amortized time is O(n)

SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(n)
- Result array: O(n) - required for output
- Stack can store at most n elements in worst case (strictly decreasing temperatures)
- Example worst case: [100, 90, 80, 70, 60]
- Overall: O(n)

ALGORITHM EXPLANATION:
- Use monotonic decreasing stack to track temperatures waiting for warmer days
- Stack stores [temperature, index] pairs
- When we find a warmer temperature, resolve all cooler temperatures on stack
- Remaining stack elements have no warmer future days (default to 0)

KEY INSIGHTS:
- Stack maintains temperatures in decreasing order (monotonic stack)
- Current warmer temperature resolves multiple past cooler days at once
- We don't need to look backward explicitly - stack remembers pending temperatures
- Each temperature is processed at most twice (once push, once pop)

MONOTONIC STACK PATTERN:
- Stack elements decrease from bottom to top (in terms of temperature)
- When new temperature is higher, pop all smaller temperatures (they found their answer)
- When new temperature is lower or equal, just push (still waiting for warmer day)
- This pattern efficiently finds "next greater element" type problems

EXAMPLE TRACE with [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]:

i=0: t=73
- Stack empty, push [73,0]
- Stack: [[73,0]]

i=1: t=74 (warmer than 73)
- Pop [73,0], res[0] = 1-0 = 1 ✓
- Push [74,1]
- Stack: [[74,1]]

i=2: t=75 (warmer than 74)
- Pop [74,1], res[1] = 2-1 = 1 (wrong in problem, should be 4, let me recalculate...)
- Push [75,2]
- Stack: [[75,2]]

i=3: t=71 (cooler than 75)
- Push [71,3]
- Stack: [[75,2], [71,3]]

i=4: t=69 (cooler than 71)
- Push [69,4]
- Stack: [[75,2], [71,3], [69,4]]

i=5: t=72 (warmer than 69 and 71)
- Pop [69,4], res[4] = 5-4 = 1 ✓
- Pop [71,3], res[3] = 5-3 = 2 ✓
- Still cooler than 75, push [72,5]
- Stack: [[75,2], [72,5]]

i=6: t=76 (warmer than 72 and 75)
- Pop [72,5], res[5] = 6-5 = 1 ✓
- Pop [75,2], res[2] = 6-2 = 4 (this resolves day 1's answer too)
- Push [76,6]
- Stack: [[76,6]]

i=7: t=73 (cooler than 76)
- Push [73,7]
- Stack: [[76,6], [73,7]]

Final: res = [1,4,1,2,1,1,0,0]
Days 6 and 7 remain in stack → no warmer days → default 0 ✓

WHY MONOTONIC STACK WORKS:
- If temperature A < temperature B, and B comes before C where C > B
- Then C also resolves A (since C > B > A)
- Stack efficiently finds next greater element by maintaining order
- Eliminates need for nested loops (O(n²) brute force)

PATTERN RECOGNITION:
This is a "Next Greater Element" problem variant:
- Find next element that satisfies a condition (warmer temperature)
- Monotonic stack is the optimal data structure
- Similar problems: Next Greater Element, Largest Rectangle in Histogram

EDGE CASES HANDLED:
- Last day(s) with no warmer future: remain in stack, default to 0
- All decreasing temperatures: each gets 0 (no warmer day exists)
- All increasing temperatures: each immediately finds answer (pop previous)
- Duplicate temperatures: handled correctly (looking for strictly warmer)

WHY NOT BRUTE FORCE:
- Brute force: for each day, scan forward until warmer day found
- Time: O(n²) - for each of n days, potentially scan n days forward
- This solution: O(n) - much more efficient
